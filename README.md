## Risk Disclaimer
This application employs a simplified trading model that does not limit slippage. During transaction execution, the final transaction price may deviate from your expected price. If you require professional trading features with finer slippage control, please use other decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

AlwaysDogAPP is an experimental project. The developers strive to maintain stable operation but do not guarantee the continuity of services or absolute security of transactions. Users must bear the risks and losses that may arise from using this application.

## ADOG Token
AlwaysDog (ADOG) tokens are provided as complimentary rewards for using the platform. Currently, these tokens have no real-world value and are offered only as a thank-you gift within the application. Future use cases may be developed, but users should not have high expectations regarding its value at this time.
